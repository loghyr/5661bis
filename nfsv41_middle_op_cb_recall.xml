    <section toc='exclude' anchor="ss:op_CB_RECALL:D" title="DESCRIPTION">
      <t>
        The CB_RECALL operation is used to begin the process of recalling a
        delegation and returning it to the server.
      </t>

      <t>
        The truncate flag is used to optimize recall for a file object that
        is a regular file and is about to be truncated to zero.  When it is
        TRUE, the client is freed of the obligation to propagate modified
        data for the file to the server, since this data is irrelevant.
      </t>

      <t>
        If the handle specified is not one for which the client holds a
        delegation, an NFS4ERR_BADHANDLE error is returned.
      </t>

      <t>
        If the stateid specified is not one corresponding to an OPEN
        delegation for the file specified by the filehandle, an
        NFS4ERR_BAD_STATEID is returned.
      </t>

    <section toc='exclude' anchor="ss:op_CB_RECALL:I" title="IMPLEMENTATION">
      <t>
        The client SHOULD reply to the callback immediately.  Replying does
        not complete the recall except when the value of the reply's status
        field is neither NFS4ERR_DELAY nor NFS4_OK.  The recall is not
        complete until the delegation is returned using a DELEGRETURN
        operation.
