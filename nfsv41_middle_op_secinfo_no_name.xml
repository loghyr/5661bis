    <section toc='exclude' anchor="ss:op_SECINFO_NO_NAME:D" title="DESCRIPTION">
      <t>
        Like the SECINFO operation, SECINFO_NO_NAME is used by the client to
        obtain a list of valid RPC authentication flavors for a specific file
        object.  Unlike SECINFO, SECINFO_NO_NAME only works with objects that
        are accessed by filehandle.
      </t>

      <t>
        There are two styles of SECINFO_NO_NAME, as determined by the value
        of the secinfo_style4 enumeration.  If SECINFO_STYLE4_CURRENT_FH is
        passed, then SECINFO_NO_NAME is querying for the required security
        for the current filehandle.  If SECINFO_STYLE4_PARENT is passed, then
        SECINFO_NO_NAME is querying for the required security of the current
        filehandle's parent where the current filehandle MUST be that of directory
        (an object of type NF4DIR).  If the style selected is SECINFO_STYLE4_PARENT,
        then SECINFO should apply the same access methodology used for
        LOOKUPP when evaluating the traversal to the parent directory.
        Therefore, if the requester does not have the appropriate access to
        LOOKUPP the parent, then SECINFO_NO_NAME must behave the same way and
        return NFS4ERR_ACCESS.
      </t>

      <t>
        If PUTFH, PUTPUBFH, PUTROOTFH, or RESTOREFH returns NFS4ERR_WRONGSEC,
        then the client resolves the situation by sending a COMPOUND request
        that consists of PUTFH, PUTPUBFH, or PUTROOTFH immediately followed
        by SECINFO_NO_NAME, style SECINFO_STYLE4_CURRENT_FH.  See <xref target="ss:core_infrastructure:SSN" />
        for instructions on dealing with NFS4ERR_WRONGSEC error returns from
        PUTFH, PUTROOTFH, PUTPUBFH, or RESTOREFH.
      </t>

      <t>
        If SECINFO_STYLE4_PARENT is specified and there is no parent
        directory, SECINFO_NO_NAME MUST return NFS4ERR_NOENT.
      </t>

      <t>
        On success, the current filehandle is consumed (see
        <xref target="ss:core_infrastructure:OaSaS" />), and if the next operation after SECINFO_NO_NAME
        tries to use the current filehandle, that operation will fail with
        the status NFS4ERR_NOFILEHANDLE.
      </t>

      <t>
        Everything else about SECINFO_NO_NAME is the same as SECINFO.  See
        the discussion on SECINFO (<xref target="ss:op_SECINFO:D" />).
