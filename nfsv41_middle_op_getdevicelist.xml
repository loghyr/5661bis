    <section toc='exclude' anchor="ss:op_GETDEVICELIST:D" title="DESCRIPTION">
      <t>
        This operation is used by the client to enumerate all of the device
        IDs that a server's file system uses.
      </t>

      <t>
        The client provides a current filehandle of a file object that
        belongs to the file system (i.e., all file objects sharing the same
        fsid as that of the current filehandle) and the layout type in
        gdia_layout_type.  Since this operation might require multiple calls
        to enumerate all the device IDs (and is thus similar to the READDIR
        (<xref target="op_READDIR" />) operation), the client also provides gdia_cookie and
        gdia_cookieverf to specify the current cursor position in the list.
        When the client wants to read from the beginning of the file system's
        device mappings, it sets gdla_cookie to zero.  The field
        gdla_cookieverf MUST be ignored by the server when gdla_cookie is
        zero.  The client provides gdla_maxdevices to limit the number of
        device IDs in the result.  If gdla_maxdevices is zero, the server
        MUST return NFS4ERR_INVAL.  The server MAY return fewer device IDs.
      </t>

      <t>
        The successful response to the operation will contain the cookie,
        gdlr_cookie, and the cookie verifier, gdlr_cookieverf, to be used on
        the subsequent GETDEVICELIST.  A gdlr_eof value of TRUE signifies
        that there are no remaining entries in the server's device list.
        Each element of gdlr_deviceid_list contains a device ID.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section toc='exclude' anchor="ss:op_GETDEVICELIST:I" title="IMPLEMENTATION">
      <t>
        An example of the use of this operation is for pNFS clients and
        servers that use LAYOUT4_BLOCK_VOLUME layouts.  In these environments
        it may be helpful for a client to determine device accessibility upon
        first file system access.
