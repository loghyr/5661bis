    <section toc='exclude' anchor="ss:op_DESTROY_CLIENTID:D" title="DESCRIPTION">
      <t>
        The DESTROY_CLIENTID operation destroys the client ID.  If there are
        sessions (both idle and non-idle), opens, locks, delegations,
        layouts, and/or wants (<xref target="op_WANT_DELEGATION" />) associated with the unexpired
        lease of the client ID, the server MUST return NFS4ERR_CLIENTID_BUSY.
        DESTROY_CLIENTID MAY be preceded with a SEQUENCE operation as long as
        the client ID derived from the session ID of SEQUENCE is not the same
        as the client ID to be destroyed.  If the client IDs are the same,
        then the server MUST return NFS4ERR_CLIENTID_BUSY.
      </t>

      <t>
        If DESTROY_CLIENTID is not prefixed by SEQUENCE, it MUST be the only
        operation in the COMPOUND request (otherwise, the server MUST return
        NFS4ERR_NOT_ONLY_OP).  If the operation is sent without a SEQUENCE
        preceding it, a client that retransmits the request may receive an
        error in response, because the original request might have been
        successfully executed.
      </t>

    <section toc='exclude' anchor="ss:op_DESTROY_CLIENTID:I" title="IMPLEMENTATION">
      <t>
        DESTROY_CLIENTID allows a server to immediately reclaim the resources
        consumed by an unused client ID, and also to forget that it ever
        generated the client ID.  By forgetting that it ever generated the
        client ID, the server can safely reuse the client ID on a future
        EXCHANGE_ID operation.
