    <section toc='exclude' anchor="ss:op_VERIFY:D" title="DESCRIPTION">
      <t>
        The VERIFY operation is used to verify that attributes have the value
        assumed by the client before proceeding with the following operations
        in the COMPOUND request.  If any of the attributes do not match, then
        the error NFS4ERR_NOT_SAME must be returned.  The current filehandle
        retains its value after successful completion of the operation.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section toc='exclude' anchor="ss:op_VERIFY:I" title="IMPLEMENTATION">
      <t>
        One possible use of the VERIFY operation is the following series of
        operations.  With this, the client is attempting to verify that the
        file being removed will match what the client expects to be removed.
        This series can help prevent the unintended deletion of a file.
      </t>

        </artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>
        This series does not prevent a second client from removing and
        creating a new file in the middle of this sequence, but it does help
        avoid the unintended result.
      </t>

      <t>
        In the case that a RECOMMENDED attribute is specified in the VERIFY
        operation and the server does not support that attribute for the file
        system object, the error NFS4ERR_ATTRNOTSUPP is returned to the
        client.
      </t>

      <t>
        When the attribute rdattr_error or any set-only attribute (e.g.,
        time_modify_set) is specified, the error NFS4ERR_INVAL is returned to
        the client.
