    <section toc='exclude' anchor="ss:op_CB_PUSH_DELEG:D" title="DESCRIPTION">
      <t>
        CB_PUSH_DELEG is used by the server both to signal to the client that
        the delegation it wants (previously indicated via a want established
        from an OPEN or WANT_DELEGATION operation) is available and to
        simultaneously offer the delegation to the client.  The client has
        the choice of accepting the delegation by returning NFS4_OK to the
        server, delaying the decision to accept the offered delegation by
        returning NFS4ERR_DELAY, or permanently rejecting the offer of the
        delegation by returning NFS4ERR_REJECT_DELEG.  When a delegation is
        rejected in this fashion, the want previously established is
        permanently deleted and the delegation is subject to acquisition by
        another client.
      </t>

    <section toc='exclude' anchor="ss:op_CB_PUSH_DELEG:I" title="IMPLEMENTATION">
      <t>
        If the client does return NFS4ERR_DELAY and there is a conflicting
        delegation request, the server MAY process it at the expense of the
        client that returned NFS4ERR_DELAY.  The client's want will not be
        cancelled, but MAY be processed behind other delegation requests or
        registered wants.
      </t>

      <t>
        When a client returns a status other than NFS4_OK, NFS4ERR_DELAY, or
        NFS4ERR_REJECT_DELAY, the want remains pending, although servers may
        decide to cancel the want by sending a CB_WANTS_CANCELLED.
