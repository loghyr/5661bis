    <section toc='exclude' anchor="ss:op_CB_GETATTR:D" title="DESCRIPTION">
      <t>
        The CB_GETATTR operation is used by the server to obtain the current
        modified state of a file that has been OPEN_DELEGATE_WRITE delegated.
        The size and change attributes are the only ones guaranteed to be
        serviced by the client.  See <xref target="ss:client-side_caching:HoC" /> for a full description of
        how the client and server are to interact with the use of CB_GETATTR.
      </t>

      <t>
        If the filehandle specified is not one for which the client holds an
        OPEN_DELEGATE_WRITE delegation, an NFS4ERR_BADHANDLE error is
        returned.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section toc='exclude' anchor="ss:op_CB_GETATTR:I" title="IMPLEMENTATION">
      <t>
        The client returns attrmask bits and the associated attribute values
        only for the change attribute, and attributes that it may change
        (time_modify, and size).
