<section anchor="sec:nfsv4.1_callback" title="NFSv4.1 Callback Procedures">
  <t>
    The procedures used for callbacks are defined in the following
    sections.  In the interest of clarity, the terms "client" and
    "server" refer to NFS clients and servers, despite the fact that for
    an individual callback RPC, the sense of these terms would be
    precisely the opposite.

  <t>
    Both procedures, CB_NULL and CB_COMPOUND, MUST be implemented.
