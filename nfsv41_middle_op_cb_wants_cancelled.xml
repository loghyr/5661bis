    <section toc='exclude' anchor="ss:op_CB_WANTS_CANCELLED:D" title="DESCRIPTION">
      <t>
        The CB_WANTS_CANCELLED operation is used to notify the client that
        some or all of the wants it registered for recallable delegations and
        layouts have been cancelled.
      </t>

      <t>
        If cwca_contended_wants_cancelled is TRUE, this indicates that the
        server will not be pushing to the client any delegations that become
        available after contention passes.
      </t>

      <t>
        If cwca_resourced_wants_cancelled is TRUE, this indicates that the
        server will not notify the client when there are resources on the
        server to grant delegations or layouts.
      </t>

      <t>
        After receiving a CB_WANTS_CANCELLED operation, the client is free to
        attempt to acquire the delegations or layouts it was waiting for, and
        possibly re-register wants.

    <section toc='exclude' anchor="ss:op_CB_WANTS_CANCELLED:I" title="IMPLEMENTATION">
      <t>
        When a client has an OPEN, WANT_DELEGATION, or GET_DIR_DELEGATION
        request outstanding, when a CB_WANTS_CANCELLED is sent, the server
        may need to make clear to the client whether a promise to signal
        delegation availability happened before the CB_WANTS_CANCELLED and is
        thus covered by it, or after the CB_WANTS_CANCELLED in which case it
        was not covered by it.  The server can make this distinction by
        putting the appropriate requests into the list of referring calls in
        the associated CB_SEQUENCE.
