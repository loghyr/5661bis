The editor for the NFSv4.1 bis internet draft uses this site as a method of distributing content and issue tracking. The latest version of the NFSv4.1 I-D is always found on the IETF site. The NFSv4 WG page will have pointers to all of this and includes a pointer to the email archive as well.

NOTE: The drafts contained here may change after they are posted to the IETF site. The ITEF site is always the definitive authority on content.

SECRET NOTE: While these documents can serve as 5661bis, they are mainly being used to track changes to 5661 before the bis work starts. The issue board and the tasklist for 3530bis were cumbersome. The intent here is to make changes right away instead of issuing vague AIs.

For comparative purposes, the orginal rfc5661.txt and rfc5661bis.txt are also stored here, mainly to show the set of diffs from the cut-in. (Although now I think of it, D'oh!, version control!)

To compile the XML files into text files:

1. Install xml2rfc 
   http://xml.resource.org/

   These instructions have been tested with version 1.34pre3

2. Place xml2rfc in your path

   For example, setenv PATH $PATH":/Users/thomas/Documents/ietf/bin/xml2rfc-1.36"

3. Build

   > make
