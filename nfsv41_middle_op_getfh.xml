    <section toc='exclude' anchor="ss:op_GETFH:D" title="DESCRIPTION">
      <t>
        This operation returns the current filehandle value.
      </t>

      <t>
        On success, the current filehandle retains its value.
      </t>

      <t>
        As described in <xref target="ss:core_infrastructure:CaCCI" />, GETFH is REQUIRED or RECOMMENDED to
        immediately follow certain operations, and servers are free to reject
        such operations if the client fails to insert GETFH in the request as
        REQUIRED or RECOMMENDED.  <xref target="ss:op_OPEN:WtCI" /> provides additional
        justification for why GETFH MUST follow OPEN.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section toc='exclude' anchor="ss:op_GETFH:I" title="IMPLEMENTATION">
      <t>
        Operations that change the current filehandle like LOOKUP or CREATE
        do not automatically return the new filehandle as a result.  For
        instance, if a client needs to look up a directory entry and obtain
        its filehandle, then the following request is needed.
