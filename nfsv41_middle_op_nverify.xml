    <section toc='exclude' anchor="ss:op_NVERIFY:D" title="DESCRIPTION">
      <t>
        This operation is used to prefix a sequence of operations to be
        performed if one or more attributes have changed on some file system
        object.  If all the attributes match, then the error NFS4ERR_SAME
        MUST be returned.
      </t>

      <t>
        On success, the current filehandle retains its value.

    <section toc='exclude' anchor="ss:op_NVERIFY:I" title="IMPLEMENTATION">
      <t>
        This operation is useful as a cache validation operator.  If the
        object to which the attributes belong has changed, then the following
        operations may obtain new data associated with that object, for
        instance, to check if a file has been changed and obtain new data if
        it has:
      </t>

      <figure>
        <artwork>
    SEQUENCE
    PUTFH fh
    NVERIFY attrbits attrs
    READ 0 32767
        </artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>
        Contrast this with NFSv3, which would first send a GETATTR in one
        request/reply round trip, and then if attributes indicated that the
        client's cache was stale, then send a READ in another request/reply
        round trip.
      </t>

      <t>
        In the case that a RECOMMENDED attribute is specified in the NVERIFY
        operation and the server does not support that attribute for the file
        system object, the error NFS4ERR_ATTRNOTSUPP is returned to the
        client.
      </t>

      <t>
        When the attribute rdattr_error or any set-only attribute (e.g.,
        time_modify_set) is specified, the error NFS4ERR_INVAL is returned to
        the client.
