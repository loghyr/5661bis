    <section toc='exclude' anchor="ss:op_CB_ILLEGAL:D" title="DESCRIPTION">
      <t>
        This operation is a placeholder for encoding a result to handle the
        case of the server sending an operation code within CB_COMPOUND that
        is not defined in the NFSv4.1 specification.  See <xref target="ss:proc_CB_COMPOUND:D" /> for
        more details.
      </t>

      <t>
        The status field of CB_ILLEGAL4res MUST be set to NFS4ERR_OP_ILLEGAL.

    </section>

    <section toc='exclude' anchor="ss:op_CB_ILLEGAL:I" title="IMPLEMENTATION">
      <t>
        A server will probably not send an operation with code OP_CB_ILLEGAL,
        but if it does, the response will be CB_ILLEGAL4res just as it would
        be with any other invalid operation code.  Note that if the client
      </t>

      <t>
        gets an illegal operation code that is not OP_ILLEGAL, and if the
        client checks for legal operation codes during the XDR decode phase,
        then an instance of data type CB_ILLEGAL4res will not be returned.
