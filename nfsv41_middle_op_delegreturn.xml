    <section toc='exclude' anchor="ss:op_DELEGRETURN:D" title="DESCRIPTION">
      <t>
        The DELEGRETURN operation returns the delegation represented by the
        current filehandle and stateid.
      </t>

      <t>
        Delegations may be returned voluntarily (i.e., before the server has
        recalled them) or when recalled.  In either case, the client must
        properly propagate state changed under the context of the delegation
        to the server before returning the delegation.
      </t>

      <t>
        The server MAY require that the principal, security flavor, and if
        applicable, the GSS mechanism, combination that acquired the
        delegation also be the one to send DELEGRETURN on the file.  This
        might not be possible if credentials for the principal are no longer
        available.  The server MAY allow the machine credential or SSV
        credential (see <xref target="op_EXCHANGE_ID" />) to send DELEGRETURN.
