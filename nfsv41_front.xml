    <t>
        This document describes the Network File System (NFS) version 4 minor
        version 1, including features retained from the base protocol (NFS
        version 4 minor version 0, which is specified in RFC 3530) and
        protocol extensions made subsequently.  Major extensions introduced
        in NFS version 4 minor version 1 include Sessions, Directory
        Delegations, and parallel NFS (pNFS).  NFS version 4 minor version 1
        has no dependencies on NFS version 4 minor version 0, and it is
        considered a separate protocol.  Thus, this document neither updates
        nor obsoletes RFC 3530.  NFS minor version 1 is deemed superior to
        NFS minor version 0 with no loss of functionality, and its use is
        preferred over version 0.  Both NFS minor versions 0 and 1 can be
        used simultaneously on the same network, between the same client and
        server.
